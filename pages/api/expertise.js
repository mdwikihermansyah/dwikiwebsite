The process starts with User Experience (UX), which involves researching user needs and behaviors to map out a logical and easy-to-navigate journey within an app or website. This foundational structure is then brought to life through User Interface (UI) design, which focuses on the visual elements like color schemes, typography, and buttons. In short, their goal is to transform complex systems into a seamless and enjoyable experience, ensuring the final product is not just functional, but also feels good to use.",
